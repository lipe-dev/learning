# Learning!

The moment we stop learning is the moment we stop being human.

Some time ago I realized something very important: I have always like learning new stuff, but have fallen into an unhealthy routine of just getting my work done and only ever learning whatever was necessary to achieve that. So I decided to "go back to school" and start learning stuff that interests me. This includes relearning tech that I have used to death like React, but with a different perspective, all the way to learning stuff that I know I will never use professionally, like developing a dumb game with Pico8.

I am not doing this for the glory, nor is this project meant to be me "showing off". TBH it is just a backup of all the code I wrote while learning stuff so I can reference it later. Here you will find exclusively code that was written during courses and tutorials. After learning the basics I usually go for building an actual app with the new tech I learned which will go into its own repo.

## Certs

These are the courses I've completed that warranted me a certificate! Developing actual apps with this stuff is much more interesting than a certificate could ever be, but I still think these look neat and I like them.
